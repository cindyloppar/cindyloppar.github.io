# Binary Agents

When I read the problem from freecodecamp I was a bit confused but I read it again and again, I then thought of ASCII character codes and what can I use inoder to solve the challenge I am given.

## Problem

Return an English translated sentence of the passed binary string.
The binary string will be space separated.

## Approach
I first splited the numbers each of them and had an empty array. I therefore added a for-loop to iterate through each number and pushed using from char code and changed the long big numbers to decimal numbers, so that they change the numbers to its own characters, then joined them together.

## Conclusion
It becomes harder to solve the problem given when one do not really understand and what is needed from him/her, but the moment I read the challenge all over again it made sence and I remembered what to use and that's how it became much better for me to solve the problem.
