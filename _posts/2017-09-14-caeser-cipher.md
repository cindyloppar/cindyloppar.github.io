Caeser Cipher

The caeser Cipher, also known as a shift cipher, is one of the simplest forms of encryption. It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the original message (called the plaintext) is replaced with a letter corresponding to a certain number of letters up or down in the alphabet.

To solve a Caeser Cipher

Caeser Cipher decryption replaces a letter another with an inverse alphabet shift a previous letter.

JavaScript Prototypes
Every javascript has a prototype and it is also an object.

All javascript objects inherit the properties and methods from their prototype.
Objects created using an object literal, or eith object(), inherit from a prototype called object.prototype.

All javascript object(Data, Array, RegExp, Function, ..) inherit from the object.prototype.

.Filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test.
