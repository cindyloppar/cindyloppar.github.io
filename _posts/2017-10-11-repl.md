Read evaluate print loop(Repl)

also known as an interactive toplevel or language shell, is a simple, interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs, evaluates them, and returns the result to the user.

Read function accepts an expression from the user, and parses it into a data structure in memory.

Evaluation function takes this internal data structure and evaluates it.

Print function takes the result yielded by evaluating them, and prints it out to the user.
