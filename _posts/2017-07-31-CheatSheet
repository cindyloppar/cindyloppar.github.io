		CheatSheet

Cheatsheet are very useful when we need to get quick help and in many cases we forget about some codes.

It is also good to make your own cheatsheet according to your weakness and strengths.

	Coral Site Script
CORAL runs with a MySQL 5 backend. Each CORAL module uses its own MySQL schema. The recommended format for schema name is coral_MODULENAME_prod, e.g. coral_resources_prod. Since the database name is set in the configuration.ini file this name can be easily changed. For security purposes it is recommended to have a “coral” user which has select, insert, update and delete privileges only (no create table privileges). This “coral” user should have access to all CORAL databases for interoperability.

		Regular Expression
A regular expression, regex or regexp[1] (sometimes called a rational expression)[2][3] is, in theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually this pattern is then used by string searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings.
