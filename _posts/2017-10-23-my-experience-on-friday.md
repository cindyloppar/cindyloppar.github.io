My experience about friday was a big disappointment not to Mandla only but myself too, 
I could hardly remember most of the things I did, learned and taught. I was looking 
forward to friday which sadly turned out into a disappointment.

I think I do not practice enough as I could hardly remember what I was supposed to do and on Freecode camp 
some of the things which we do I always get clues which help me to understand and again I google or ask for 
help on my peers and I understand for that moment my prolem is that I do not practice more so that I get full 
understanding about what I am learning. 

Moving forward I want to practice everything I am learning and taught be a day to day thing which I get used to
as I want to see myself somewhere in life and I am determined to make this work and I will work so hard to see my 
dreams become true.

Thank you for the help and the effort you guys put on us and the trust and I am sorry for such a disappointment, it also 
touched my heart seeing Mandla so disappointed in us and to myself too it became a big disappointment. There is nothing wrong 
which you guys are doing as I am to be blamed for not practicing enough and push myself so hard and from now on I will push 
because this opportunity is one in a million and in which one maybe really ineed of it but I got the opportunity and I do appreciate 
it and will work so hard. Thank you once again to all of you guys.
