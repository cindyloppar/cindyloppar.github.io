# Symmetric Difference

It is not an easy activity and I am confused. Though I understand the concept behind and how it should work so logically this makes sence but when it comes to code it becomes confusing.

## Problem

Create a function that takes two or more arrays and returns an array of the symmetric difference (△ or ⊕) of the provided arrays.

## Approach

I am trying to use a for-loop, which will iterate through and pushed the result into the empty array I already assigned to.
I tried using an if statement which will check the if the number exists on the other array and if not it should push them to the empty array.
I also tried using reduce but then it didnt work.

## Conclusion

The Approach I had in mind never worked and I had to ask for help from my peers and that I should get a better understanding about this activity.
