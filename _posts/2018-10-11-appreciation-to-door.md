# Appreciation

My name is Cindy Mahlangu, The Coding Ground student. I as a student of the coding ground I would like to say thank you and I really appreciate the funds you have contributed to the coding ground. This will make a different in my life such as me being able to continue being here at the coding ground.

You have given us an opportunity to learn and be able to build a better future for myself. I will take this opportunity and use it to the best of my ability and make a difference in my life and also help change another student's life by learning as much as I can, with the funds you have donated we will be able to receive travelling money, buying food, paying rent where we are situated, access to internet and maintaining other things.This is all possible because of you but not for me only and also the other students here at the coding ground. Thank you for helping to build our future for the better.

The guidance we are receiving from the leaders of the coding ground we believe in ourselves and they give us hope, for us to strive for the better and by you realizing the importance of this program it means a lot to us and for us to achieve our goals. 

## Conclusion 

Thank you for your support. Your compassion enriches our lives as the coding ground students. We are so grateful for your support. Thank you for believing in us.
