## Learning html

I have learn a lot in the past two days i have been here,
since well this is my second blog post i want to share my experience about 
coding ground.

I have been learning about HTML(hypertext markup language), which is a very interesting 
language and understandable, HTML is a language used to create webpages.
In every language there is a format that one needs to follow same as HTML, 
the styling of HTML, firstly one needs to identify the document type and tell what language
is it which you using,have a title,body and style. 
Well it was funny how i wrote my first web site page because i did not write the format of 
the HTML language but then we all start there and it was part of my learning :),which is one
thing i will always keep in my mind. It is very important to always write a 
format of a language you will be using. Did you know that HTML and CSS when it comes to 
styling,one can use a CSS styling code, while his coding using HTML?, quite amazing hey!.
