# Boo-who

The activity which I was given on freecodecamp was approacheble because I was able to have ways to tackle the challege though I couldn't continue but I had a perfect start because with the final step I added, it was a build up from what I already started with.

## Problem

Check if a value is classified as a boolean primitive. Return true or false.

## Approach

I had an if-statement which says if the string is true or if the strign is false it should return true else it should return false. 

I had another solution which I used typeof the parameter should stringly equal to a boolean.

## Conclusion

It is always a great experience after one was able to have a good start when given a problem and have different ways of solving the solution and it was more interesting when I was able to come up not with one but two more solutions.
