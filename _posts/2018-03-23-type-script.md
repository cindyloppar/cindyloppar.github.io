# TypeScript

Is an open source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.

It is syntactical superset of JavaScript, meaning its a layer around JavaScript with more methods that makes you follow a way of development.

One advantage is that it will give you any error you may have in the syntax on the compiler. It is a language for application-scale JavaScript. It adds optional types, classes and modules to JavaScript.

It support tools for large-scale JavaScript application for any browser, any host, on any OS. TypeScript compiles to readable, standards-based JavaScript.
