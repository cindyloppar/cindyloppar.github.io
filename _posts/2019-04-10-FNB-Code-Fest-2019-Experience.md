# FNB Codefest 2019

The event was at the FNB Conference Center in Santon, It is a very nice place, well-organized event and well set up. We were invited by Mr. Jason Suite to attend the FNB Codefest so basically, the festival was for the FNB developers not for outsiders
but we were got to participate.

We got to be surrounded by software developers who have way more experienced than we have, though it seemed like we worked for "FNB". They all knew about OCEP. 
OCEP is a system used to build the FNB application for its employees. 


We had to build a web application to improve away the employees has to go through so many icons and go back when using the application.
Our initial goal was to make the web application user-friendly since well they had to move from icon to icon to access other stuff, By making it user-friendly we decided to go for Facebook vision where when you click the X-Hub icon on the FNB application 
You will land on a page where you find all the articles, videos and photos shared on the platform and also as a user will be able to share, like, comment, upload and tag people at your department and we had a peer to peer chat.

We had to build it using React, Node.js, and Postgres. React was used for a front end, Node.js was used for back end purposes and for Postgres was used for storing data.

Our first day of the Codefest was planning it and we got to engage with professional coach agile methodology. It was so amazing how as a term we got to planning such an amazing x-hub application. We got to draw out the structure and how we want to it to come together. The planning was so amazing the way as a team we discussed it with the help of the coaches and designing the screens.

We slept a few hours to make sure we push work and in those 48 hours we able to produce and present something to the judges. In that 48 hours, we had to keep on presenting to every person coming to our table and we had people who came explaining things which we needed such as designs and went to the OCEP gentlemen to explain to us what is OCEP and its purpose.

We had a room they offered for to sleep and take shower and had to share but some of us ended up sleeping on the bin bags, some on the coaches and some on the floor, we only went there to take shower. But it was quite and amazing feeling being surrounded by professional and experienced developers. The food was so amazing you don't get hungry, the snakes, drinks and energy drinks. They also gave us goodie bags and prizes to win too.
