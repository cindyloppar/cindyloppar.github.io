# They would normally say “Strive to do your utmost best”.

My name is Cindy Mahlangu a student at the coding ground, a young woman who is determined, passionate and I love exploring new things and places.
I learnt JavaScript, React, HTML5, Typing, Reading, so far with the coding ground. I found it fun at first learning JavaScript, React and Redux and as we go on it started being difficult and since well this is a learning curve for me this made me realise that I needed to work hard.I am now using Trello for them to keep track on what I am doing and how far I'm I with each an every project I am doing.

Things I have learnt being mentored is Respect, Determination, Curiosity (do more research ), Problem solving skills, working with a group of  people. I was a never a person who really reads a lot but since I have being part of this great journey I now read time to time and realized that reading makes the mind grows and ones mind is always open and flexible in thinking.I also learnt typing and now my speed and accuracy has improved a lot compared to when I got here.

## I have build few web pages which I am proud of myself, with JavaScript I will only name two:

#### Pomodoro Clock

Its a timer where one can set their own time, by decreasing and increasing the timer. They able to start and stop the timer.

#### Simon Game

Its game of memory skill and it flashes lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over.


## My hobbies:

Modeling brings so much joy, when I am walking on the ramp.
Reading has become one of the great things gaining more knowledge and having an open mind.
Singing makes me to relax and forget about most of the thing.
Playstation Racing cars and God of war

## What I am excited about currently

What I am currently most excited about is what I am learning currently and what I have built so far, which is React it is so amazing and for now it might be difficult but I am enjoying it. I am looking forward in building more using React. 

### This is what I have built so far using React:

#### Mark down Previewer

Markdown is a lightweight markup language, allowing people "to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)".

#### Recipe Box

Recipe box is were people are able to add their recipe and ingredients, allowing them to save, view and edit what they have added.
