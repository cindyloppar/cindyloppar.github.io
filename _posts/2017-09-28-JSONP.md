JSONP

JSON with Padding

Is a method used as an alternative for cross domain policies in web browsers.

JSON and JSONP behave differently between the client and web server, and it is not allowed to make Ajax request to a web page on a different page.

We use JSONP because is a way to get data from another domain that goes through cross origin resource sharing rules.

Cross origin resource sharing is a set of rules to transfer data between client and servers that have different doimain names.
