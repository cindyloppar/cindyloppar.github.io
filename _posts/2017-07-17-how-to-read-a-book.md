How to read a book.

There are two different ways of reading a book, you can read it for information or reading to gain knowledge. if one needs to gain knowledge it is good for him/her to read books which are above his/her current level and that is how you improve your mental capacity, when reading for entertainment one doesnt really learn nor gain more knowledge.

There are four different types of reading a book which is:
	Elementary reading
It is when one knows how to read as others

	Inspectional reading 
This is where one reads from the table of content, the index ect, which is called systematic skimming. Superficial reading it is when you just go straight to the chapter not reading from the index and table of content. Inspectional reading gives you the insight of everything about the author and understanding the chapeters of the book before reading it.

	Analytical Reading 
This is where now you dig deep about the book, getting the insight every chapter and understanding about what the author was trying to tell or give a message.

	Syntopical reading
This is when you campare books you have read and tryong to get to a point where you understand the overall of those books.


Reading to gain knowledge it is good more especially reading what you learning about more this helps one to smater and grow in what he or she is doing.
