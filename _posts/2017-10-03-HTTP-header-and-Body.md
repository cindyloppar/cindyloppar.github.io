HTTP header and body

HEAD: Retrieve Header Information. HEAD is identical to GET, except the server does not return the content in the HTTP response."When you send a HEAD request, it means that you are only interested in the response code and the HTTP headers, not the document itself."

The information, in the form of a text record, that a Web server sends back to a client's browser in response to receiving an HTTP request. The header is attached to the files being sent back to the client. Contrast with an HTTP request header.

HTTP Message Body is the data bytes transmitted in an HTTP transaction message immediately following the headers if there is any (in the case of HTTP/0.9 no headers are transmitted).

A message body is the one which carries actual HTTP request data (including form data and uploaded etc.) and HTTP response data from the server ( including files, images etc). Following is a simple content of a message body: <html> <body> <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
