The conditional(ternary) operator is the only javascript operator that takes three operators.


		String interporlation

In computer programming, string interpolation (or variable interpolation, variable substitution, or variable expansion) is the process of evaluating a string literal containing one or more placeholders, yielding a result in which the placeholders are replaced with their corresponding values. It is a form of simple template processing,or, in formal terms, a form of quasi-quotation (or logic substitution interpretation). String interpolation allows easier and more intuitive string formatting and content-specification compared with string concatenation.

String interpolation is common in many programming languages which make heavy use of string representations of data, such as Groovy, Kotlin, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Scala, and Swift, and most Unix shells.
