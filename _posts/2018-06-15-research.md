SendGrid

SendGrid Provides a cloud based email delivery service that assists business with email delivery.

The service manages various types of email including shipping notifications, friend requests, sign-up confirmations and email newsletters.

It handles internet service provides (ISP) monitoring domain keys, sender policy framework(SPF) and feedback loops.


Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an email authentication standard developed by AOL that compares the email sender’s actual IP address to a list of IP addresses authorized to send mail from that domain. The IP list is published in the domain’s DNS record.

It also allows companies to track email opens, unsubscribed. bounces and spam reports.

A feedback loop (FBL) is a service offered by some (ISPs) that report back complaints (when a subscriber hits the spam or junk button in their inbox) to senders. It’s provided to aid senders in keeping a clean list. Senders should use feedback loops to listen to their subscribers and to take action (removing subscribers) if there are complaints. It’s important to learn from the complaints you receive because they can help you evaluate (and rectify!) underlying issues with your sending frequency and content.
