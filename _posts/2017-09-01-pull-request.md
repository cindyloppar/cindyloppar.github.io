Pull Request

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before the changes are merged into the repository.

After initializing a pull request, you'll see a review page that shows a high-level overview of the changes between your branch (the compare branch) and the repository's base branch. You can add a summary of the proposed changes, review the changes made by commits, add labels, milestones, and assignees, and individual contributors or teams.



Note: When working with pull requests, keep the following in mind:

If you're working in the shared repository model, we recommend that you use a topic branch for your pull request. While you can send pull requests from any branch or commit, with a topic branch you can push follow-up commits if you need to update your proposed changes.
When pushing commits to a pull request, don't force push. Force pushing can corrupt your pull request.

Once you've created a pull request, you can push commits from your topic branch to add them to your existing pull request. These commits will appear in chronological order within your pull request and the changes will be visible in the "Files changed" tab.

Other contributors can review your proposed changes, add review comments, contribute to the pull request discussion, and even add commits to the pull request.

After you're happy with the proposed changes, you can merge the pull request. If you're working in a shared repository model, the proposed changes will be merged from the head branch to the base branch that was specified in the pull request. You can close corresponding issues using a keyword in your pull request or commit message.
