My observation from last week was that i was reading books a lot about 
design thinking user experience, comparison of multi-paradigm programming 
languages etc and learning how to type in the right way at typing club. 
I was also doing my new webpage. 

What I need to improve is the way I explain my code when we doing a review.
I also need to improve my typing skills and also read more so that I 
understand more and it can be easy for me to analyse what I have read in my
own words. I also need to learn more about design thinking so I can better 
my skills when it comes to designing my webpage or application.
