# My experience about the project

This is a continuation about my learning and experience from the previous blog on the 12th of December 2017.

On the previous blog I stated about how much I have experienced and learned by doing this project and so on this blog  I will share what I have learned and experienced in details and what was good, bad and what improvement we could make when we have more projects as a team.

It was a roller coaster kinda of an experience when I say roller coaster I mean it was mixed emotions, there were time where we were happy and proud about the project more especially at first when we were given what to do and it is something real. Planning it out and all we could see was only success and we never thought of the challenges we might face as a team and all those difficulties.

The most happiest moment about the project was when we saw that we have the minimum viable product and which was something required. It was an achievement and that we were moving fast and seeing that in the two weeks we were given were achiving something. 

When we got started it was so stressfull because now we coming across something we have never seen and trying to read the documentation of twitter API and trying by all means to understand but instead of understading its the more we got so confused and not knowing where to start and go from reading the documentation. 

The good part started when now we got to engage with someone who is more experienced and who has been in the industry for long and who knows what is important, what is not important and also what to ignore. We didn't know that and that is why it became more confusing. 
We now that seeing the light at the end of the tunnel because we are able to see where are, were we going and what to do next what is left we us to do.

We struggled alot to work as a team because we were not organised and we would get confused and never do or search what we wanted to research and get done with.
That was a big challenge but at the end when we were about to finish the project we got to work as a team and divide the tasks as a team. We even tried to move other code to its own files but we even forgot to do that as we were presenting we got a confused since well there was one file with a very long code and that became a stress and made it look like we never prepared for the Demo.
