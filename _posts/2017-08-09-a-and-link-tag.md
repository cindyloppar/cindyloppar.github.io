	Difference between <a></a> tag and <link /> tag

link tag Is an empty element, i.e can not have anything inside of it.
All it does is simplify a relationship with another document and its only used in the <head> section

a tag Is not an empty element and specifies an object to be created on the page.
e.g A clickble link ir image which takes the user to some other location.
The tag is only used in the <body> section
