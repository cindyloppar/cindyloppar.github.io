Search and Replace

ReadME

Perform a search and replace on the sentence using the arguments provided and return the new sentence.

First argument is the sentence to perform the search and replace on.

Second argument is the word that you will be replacing (before).

Third argument is what you will be replacing the second argument with (after).

NOTE: Preserve the case of the original word when you are replacing it. For example if you mean to replace the word "Book" with the word "dog", it should be replaced as "Dog"

My Solution

I have a variable index and assigned it to the senctence of str, to get the index before.

Secondly I had a for-loop and my for-loop gets the character of a string at index 0 and its upperCased, so that everytime the first  character should be upperCase.

Outside my for-loop I used replace so that the last character should be replaced on the first sentense.
 

This exersice gave me a challenge and I had to research more for me to understand what was required of me.
