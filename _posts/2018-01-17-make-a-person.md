# Make a person

Assigned a varaible name with a function and one parameter, this method which gets a full name using a function and access it from outside the function where a new value was assigned so that a function can access it.
I had another two get function which gets the first name and the other one gets the last name. I splitted them then got them using their index.

Therefore I had three set functions I used the this function to set the first name and last name,then gave them parameters each an every set I did and splitted them then accessed them with their index.
the last one which was setting the full name I only gave it the parameter and set it by using the index.

 this.setFullName = function(firstandlast){
    firstAndLast = firstandlast;
    return firstAndLast;
  };

## Conslusion

The excise was not hard because the guideline was straigh and forward so it wasn't complicated at all and I could understand though I made a bit of mistakes with accessign them but I was assisted quickly.
