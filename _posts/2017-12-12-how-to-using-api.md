How to tweet using API

This blog is about my learning experience on how it is to be a developer and to get a real feeling about it is.
I learned and got to experience frastrations, fun and lots and lots of learning about how is it to be a developer 
Problem 

We were given a project me and my team to complete in two weeks time, which was a social media publishing tool, so basically the project is about one being able to post an image or text using one of the social media api's.

Approach

Firstly one needs to understand what is an API and what it does. So that means we all had to google and find information about API's, we seached for different API's. 

Secondly We created a twitter App and got Access and Secret tokens to use when writing our code, we then installed javascript libraries express, require, request and querystring, using node. Node is an open-source, cross-platform, runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. 


Conclusion

It was an absolute great experience, fun and fustrating. I though frustrating is fun but what I have experence its not really fun, Well I wish to do more apps or websites so that I get used to the feeling and find ways to manage all of the frustration and find easy ways to tackle problems.
