# Drop it

The activity wasn't bad  as I though at first before reading it thoroughly, and I was able to relate to the other activities I have been doing.
## Problem

Drop the elements of an array (first argument), starting from the front, until the predicate (second argument) returns true.
The second argument, func, is a function you'll use to test the first elements of the array to decide if you should drop it or not.
Return the rest of the array, otherwise return an empty array.

## Approach

I first had an empty array, followed by a for-loop and inside the for-loop its an if-statement which checks if the numbers passed in is true and a return statement that checks each an every item in the array and if the items matches it should be tru and if the item is not there it should retrun an empty arry.

## Conclusion

It wasn't a very difficult task I was able to tackle it and try to solve it though I got a bit stuck but I was able to remove what wasn't needed and add what was needed.
