## Everything be true

When I read the problem I was given on freecodecamp I wasn't sure what to us inoder to complete the challenge but I could understand that I need to check if the second argumet is true.

# Problem

Check if the predicate (second argument) is truthy on all elements of a collection (first argument).
Remember, you can access object properties through either dot notation or [] notation.

# Approach

I went and googled about truthy and falsy, I got more understanding about them and I attempted the problem.
I had a for-loop which will iterate through the first array with objects inside and an If-statement to check which index is in same position with the second object if not the same, which return false and if it is should return true. 

# Conclusion

It was an interesting challenge because I got a revision about truthy and falsy and it became clear when I read more.
