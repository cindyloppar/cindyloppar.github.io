# Sorted Union

This activity which I was given was tricky and not easy though I thought of a for-loop that will iterate through but it  was difficult to continue from there.

## Problem

I was required to write a function that takes two or more arrays and returns a new array of unique values in the order of the original provided arrays.

The program has to return a new array of unique values from two original arrays in the order they show up. So there is not sorting required, and there shouldnâ€™t be any duplicates.

## Approach

Assigned an empty array that creates an empty array to store our final result.

first for-loop that iterates through the arguments object to truly made the program work with two or more arrays
instead of 3.

A for-loop that loops through the array on the other array.

I have an if-statement which checks if the value is already on the final array, which checks each an every index therefore I push it to the finalArray.

## Conslusion 

It was not easy as I thought but my first approach before I got help was useful since we got to build on top on it and I am glad because I had a clue of where to start it didn't become so frustrating as I thought it would be.
