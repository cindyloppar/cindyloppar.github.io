Software Development is like creating a work of art, because it requires designs and 
craftships in oder for it to be complete.

 Separation of Design and Construction
Design which is difficult to prepare and requires expensive and creative people.
Construction it is easier once the planning and the design it is done we can even 
predict how it going to look like.

 Software and Construction
In software construction is so cheap as in to be free
In software all the efforts is design and thus requires creative and tallented people
Creative processes are not easily plnned and so predict.

It is good for a constumer to be part of the project every step of the way because the 
project might require changenges. The most accurate is to get and honest feedx back and to 
know where we are and feedback it is for iterstiong development.
