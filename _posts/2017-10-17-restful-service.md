RESTful Service

REST- Stands for Rpresentational State Transfer

It relies on a stateless,client-server,cacheable communications protocol and in virtually all cases, the HTTP protocol is used.

REST is an architecture style for designing networked applications.
Is not a standard itself, but RESTful implematations make use of standards, such as HTTP, URL, JSON and XML.

RESTful - Is used to rest to web services implementing such as architecture.

We use RESTful web services to potry the working of the REST API, can be used to modify or view resources on the server without performing any server-side operation.

Rest call 

We use HTTP to make calls between machines.
