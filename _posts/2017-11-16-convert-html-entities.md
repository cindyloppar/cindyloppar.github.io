# Convert HTML Entities

On the activity I was given on freecodecamp to solve, the first thing I could think of after reading the problem was to solve the problem by using regular expressions.

## Problem

I have to create a program that will convert HTML entities from string to their corresponding HTML entities. 

## Approach

I first googled HTML entities to get more understanding and how will I convert the signs with the normal HTML entities.

I used regular expressions to solve the problem and it was easy just to replace everything with HTML entities.

I replaced the all the following '&','<','>','"',''' signs by HTML entities and I returned my str and the problem was solved.

## Conclusion

I managed to solve the problem which I was given and the more I do these activities the more I recall things I have learned and  especially when I get to understand what the problem is and what do I need to do to solve the problem.
