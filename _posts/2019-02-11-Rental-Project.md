# Storage System Application Project

We were tasked to build a full stack application and it was Storage Application. The aim of building this project was for us to learn how to build a full stack application which was front-end and a back-end development application.

The first thing that came to mind was will I pull this off or I will just mess up and not even enjoy working on this project. 

## Rental Storage
I named the storage application Rental Storage, I found it quite interesting to be building a full stack project. 

## The tools I used to build the project

### Postgres

I used Postgres for my database to store and retrieve the user's details. I found Postgres very easy to use and much understandable.

### React Redux Forms
 
 Oh! These tools form it worked wonders for me. It made everything so simple and made my form structure to be beautiful and clean. But most of the time I used to react to my application.
