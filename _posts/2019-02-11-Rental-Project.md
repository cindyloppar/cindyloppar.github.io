# Storage System Application Project

We were tasked to build a full stack application and it was the storage application. The aim of building this project was for us to learn how to build a full stack project which was the front-end and back-end application.

The first thing that came to mind was will I pull this off or I will just mess up and not even enjoy this project.

## Rental Storage

I named the storage application Rental Storage and I found it quite interesting to be building a full stack project and I actually enjoyed the project as we started and understanding building back-end and front-end.

## The tools I used to build the project

### Postgres

I used Postgres for my database to store and retrieve user's details. I found postgres very easy to use and much understandable.

### React Redux Forms
 
 Oh! This tools form it worked wonders for me. It made everything so simple and made my form structure to be beautiful and clean. But most of the time I used react on my application.
