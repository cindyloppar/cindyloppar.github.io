Random Article

I was required to create a random article machine which one needs to search for any thing they want 
and give you the results of what you have searched for.

In the HTML section I had a container class and the paragraph which consists of my heading, an input
consisting of search box and a serch button.

In the CSS section I had different colors and also font size for it to look attractive.

In the JavaScript section I used ajax in oder to get information from the API I were provided with to
use and I also used a for loop to get all the results of what I searched for.

In this project I have learned about ajax and read more about APIs. I also got to understand more as I did more projects.
