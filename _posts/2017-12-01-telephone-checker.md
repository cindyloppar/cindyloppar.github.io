## Telephone checker

I did have an idea of what was need from me and that I should use regular expressions inorder to complete the challenge.

# Probem

Return true if the passed string is a valid US phone number. The user may fill out the form field any way they choose as long as it is a valid US number. 

# Approach

I tried matching the first numbers but they were beginning with different numbers so it didn't work for the other testing methods.

# Conclusion

I thought regex is easy and simple to use but one needs to understand it and be able to use it.
