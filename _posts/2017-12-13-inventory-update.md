Inventory Update

The activity was challenging and I hope I will get full understanding about it and have a better understanding. 
Problem 

Compare and update the inventory stored in a 2D array against a second 2D array of a fresh delivery. Update the current existing inventory item quantities (in arr1). If an item cannot be found, add the new item and quantity into the inventory array. The returned inventory array should be in alphabetical order by item.

Approach

I assigned a variable for location, a function with a for loop which will iterate through to compare the index and the name and return the index or return undefined.
I had the second for loop again iterating through and call that index inside the array and if the index is undefine it should push the index else append the index one. I therefore sorted the array and to check if the index exits or not. 

Conclusion

The activity I was solving it wasnt an easy activity and I hope I will have a better understanding by doing it many times as possible because it was very hard.
