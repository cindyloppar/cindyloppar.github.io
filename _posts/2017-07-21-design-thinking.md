Design Thinking 

Design Thinking is a methodology used by designers to solve complex problems
and find desirable solutions for clients. A design mindset is not problem-
forced,it's solutionfocused and action oriented towards creating a preferred future.

Design thinking can be described as a discipline that uses the designer’s 
sensibility and methods to match people’s needs with what is technologically 
feasible and what a viable business strategy can convert into customer value 
and market opportunity.

Design is bronging something into existance and it is not only about how it 
looks or feels like but most impostant how it works
