CORS(Cross-origin-resource-sharing)

CORS purpose was to allow safe cross-origin data requests by voiceXML browesers, which was proposed by Matt Oshry, Brad Porter and Michael Bodell.

CORS can be used as an alternative to JSONP patterns, because JSONP supports only the GET request method, but CORS supports other types of HTTP requests.

CORS handles errors better and enables web programmer to use regular XMLHTTPRequest.

VoiceXML is a digital document standard for specifying interactive media and voice dialogs between humans and computers.
CORS allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.
