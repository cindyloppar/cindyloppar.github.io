# Telephone checker
I did have an idea of what was need from me and that I should use regular expressions inorder to complete the challenge.
Though I got stuck and I got to understand it better after we all discussed it and did a mobbing session with Thoe.

## Problem

Return true if the passed string is a valid US phone number. The user may fill out the form field any way they choose as long as it is a valid US number. 

## Approach

I first wrote a regex for the first test to yield true, so that it finds the match of the numbers which begin with one and I also had another or conditional statement which searches for to match the other numbers.

## Conclusion

It wasn't an easy task because I couldn't continue and I didn't know where to go after I began, but after we discussed and did mobbing with Theo I got to understand and was able to use ternary operator which I had already forgotten.
