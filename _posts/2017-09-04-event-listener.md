Event Listener

An event listener is  a procedure or function in a computer program that waits for event to occur, that event may be a user clicking or moving the mouse,pressing a key on the keyboard, or an internal timer or onterrupt. The listener is in effect a loop that is programmed to event react to an input or signal.

event in JavaScript

onChange - An html element has been changed

onClick - The user clicks on html element

onmouseover - The user moves the mouse over an html element.

onmouseover - The user moves the mouse away from an html element.

JavaScript interaction with html is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page. When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clickes a button, that clicks too is an event.

Event bubbling directs an event to its intented target, it works like this: A button is clicked and the event is directed to the button. If an event handler is set for that object the event is trigged.
