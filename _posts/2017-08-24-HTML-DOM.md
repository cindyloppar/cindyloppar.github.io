document.getElementbyId()

The method returns the element that has the id attribute with the specified value.

This method is one of the most common methods in the HTML Dom, and is used almost everytime you want to manipulate. or get info from, an element on your document.

document.getElementbyId().innerHTML
Is the DOM property to insert content to a specified id of an element. It is used in javascript to manipulate DOM.

document.getElementsByTagName()
Returns an HTMLCollection of elements with the given tag name. The complete document is searched, including the root node. The returned HTMLCollection is live,meaning that it updates itself automatically to stay in sync with the DOM tree without having to call document.getElementsByTagName() again.
