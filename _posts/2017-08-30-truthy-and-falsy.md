Truthy
In javascript, a truthy value is a value that is considerd true when evaluated in Boolean context. All values are truthy unless they are defined as falsy(i.e, except for false.0,"",null,undefined, and Nan).

Falsy 
A falsy value is a value that translates to false when evaluated in a Boolean context.

JavaScript uses type TypeConversion ro coerce any value to a Boolean in contexts that require it, such as conditionals and loops.

 TypeConversion/typecasting
TypConversion means tranfer of data from one data to another. Implicit conversion happens when the compiler autometically assign data types, but the source code can also explicly require a conversion to take place.
